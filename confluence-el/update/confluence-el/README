OVERVIEW
======================================================================

This is an Emacs lisp library for interacting with the Confluence Wiki
Software from Atlassian:

  http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/

It allows you to pull and edit the wiki-markup for a page and store it
back into your confluence instance.

This mode can be downloaded from:

  http://code.google.com/p/confluence-el/



INSTALLATION 
======================================================================

You must set confluence-url in your .emacs file before using the
functions in this module.  It's best to place confluence.el and
xml-rpc.el on your load path; often ~/.emacs.d or ~/elisp.

Some examples:

  (require 'confluence)
  (setq confluence-url "http://intranet/confluence/rpc/xmlrpc")

USING CONFLUENCE MODE
======================================================================

To open a page, M-x confluence-get-page and enter the path to the
page, for example, to open a page in your home space: ~username/Tasks

It is often convienient to bind this to a global key \C-xwf in your .emacs file:
  
   (global-set-key "\C-xwf")

Once you have opened a page, made changes, simply saving the page
("\C-x\C-s") will push the changes back to the wiki.

To view the chagnes in your page versus what is in the wiki, type \C-xwd
