line of a window will set the cursor within the standard scroll-margin,
causing the buffer to scroll immediately. This is usually undesired.

The command C-x C-n can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column for this command.
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as

this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as

The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil

This function differs from `previous-line' as it moves vertically
in the visual sense. The result differs when variable-width font is
used or when characters of non-standard width (e.g. TABs) are used.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider using
`forward-line' with a negative argument instead.  It is usually easier
