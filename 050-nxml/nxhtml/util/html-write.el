When this mode is on a tag in `html-write-tag-list' is displayed as
the inner text of the tag with a face corresponding to the tag.
By default for example <i>...</i> is displayed as italic and
<a>...</a> is displayed as an underlined clickable link.

Only non-nested tags are hidden.  The idea is just that it should
be easier to read and write, not that it should look as html
rendered text.

See the customization group `html-write' for more information about
faces.

IMPORTANT: Most commands you use works also on the text that is
hidden.  The movement commands is an exception, but as soon as
you edit the buffer you may also change the hidden parts."
