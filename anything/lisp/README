* To install anything:

A) The easiest way:

  1) Put the anything directory in load-path.
  2) Run make from this directory.
  3) Add to .emacs.el:
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/anything/directory")
     (require 'anything-config)

B) By copying files from anything directory

  1) Put following files somewhere in your load-path:
     - anything.el
     - anything-config.el
     - anything-match-plugin.el

  2) Byte-compile these files

  3) Add this code to .emacs.el:
     (require 'anything-config)
 
* NOTE to Distribution maintainers:(Ubuntu etc...)

Use only the files mentioned above in [1] for your packages, other files
contained in contrib directory contain deprecated or unmaintained code.
Most of the features provided in these files are present in anything-config.el.

Thanks.

* NOTE to install optional ../extensions/anything-complete.el

Additionaly, if you want to install extensions/anything-complete.el,
anything-obsolete.el is needed.
So don't forget to add to your load-path the extensions directory. 
You may want also to add anything-show-completion.el to your load-path.
These libraries will be required by anything-complete.el.
