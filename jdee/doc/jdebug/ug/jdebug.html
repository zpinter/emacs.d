<h2>About JDEbug</h2>

<p>JDEbug is a Java debugger that comes with the Java Development
Environment for Emacs. It permits you to execute a Java program
step-by-step and display information about the program at each
step. JDEbug features include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Source-level debugging. JDEbug maintains a source line
        pointer that moves as you step through a program. You can
        also set breakpoints in source buffers.</li>
    <li>Automatic local variable display. JDEbug displays the
        values of local variables as you step through source code
        and when the target process stops at a breakpoint.</li>
    <li>Object browsing. You can expand the local variable
        display to show object fields to any depth.</li>
    <li>Stack navigation. At each program step and breakpoint,
        you can move up or down the stack with a single command.
        The JDE moves the source cursor to the current line in
        the current stack frame and displays the local variables
        in that frame.</li>
    <li>Multiprocess debugging. You can control execution and
        display the internal state of multiple, independent
        processes in the same debug session.</li>
    <li>Expression evaluation. You can evaluate any expression
        that is valid at the current suspension point.</li>
    <li>Method tracing. The debugger optionally lists enties and/or
        exits from all methods of specified classes. You can
        define filters to eliminate unwanted traces.</li>
    <li>Exception tracing. The debugger optionally lists all
        exceptions of specified types. You can define filters to
        eliminate unwanted traces.</li>
</ul>
