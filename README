This is my Emacs config, made public

Initial Setup:
Clone the repository to ~/emacs.d
Create a symlink to ~/.emacs (e.g.  ln -s ~/emacs.d/.emacs ~/.emacs)

Core Ideas:

"Modules" are created by adding a folder to ~/emacs.d in the following format: ###-modulename
The number of the module determines the sequence in which it gets loaded.
Every module has an init.el file that sets up paths, loads files, defines keybindings, etc
A module can optionally include a private.el file, which gets loaded before the init.el file. These private files are kept from being versioned (via .gitignore), so you can store passwords here.

To disable a module:
Simple rename it. OFF-modulename would never get loaded, since "OFF" is not a number.
