This is my Emacs config, made public

Initial Setup:
Install the inconsolita font, or edit window-settings

Clone the repository to ~/emacs.d
Create a symlink to ~/.emacs_full (e.g.  ln -s ~/emacs.d/.emacs_full ~/.emacs)

Core Ideas:

A module is composed of the following:
lisp/    #auto-loaded to the path, contains .el files
info/    #auto-loaded to the info path
icons/   #auto-loaded to the image-load-path
init.el  #executed after load paths have been set
private.el #executed before init.el, use it to set variables for init.el that you don't want committed to the git repo

To load a module, run zconfig-load-module:
(zconfig-load-module "gnus")

To load multiple modules, run zconfig-load-modules:
(zconfig-load-modules (list
                        "core"
                        "easypg"
                        "window-settings"
                        "ido"
                        "hippie-expand"
                        "shell-current-directory"
                        "open-resource"
                        "tweaks"
                        ))

To launch emacs with a different set of modules:
emacs -nw -Q -l ~/.emacs_lite
