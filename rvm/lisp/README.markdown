rvm.el
======

This package integrates Emacs with the Ruby Version Manager ( rvm ).

Installation
------------

Just drop rvm.el in your load-path and put the following in your .emacs
  <blockquote>
        (require 'rvm)<br/>
(rvm-use-default) ;; use rvm's default ruby for the current Emacs session
    </blockquote>
Usage
-----
Just call the interactive function @rvm-activate-corresponding-ruby@ and rvm.el will change Emacs to use the right ruby version for the file in the current buffer. Remember that the new ruby version will be used for the whole Emacs session and not just the current file. If you want to switch to another ruby version manualy you can call @rvm-use@ instead.

Please note that using system-ruby is not supported in rvm.el
