Emacs support for LESS CSS (lesscss.org)
========================================

This package contains less-css-mode.el, which provides an Emacs mode
for LESS CSS (lesscss.org), complete with support for compile-on-save.

For flymake support, see [flymake-less](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-less),
though you should really use [flycheck](https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck) instead.

If you'd like Emacs to make your browser magically reload your LESS
stylesheets, consider using [skewer-less](https://github.com/purcell/skewer-less).

Please see documentation in less-css-mode.el
