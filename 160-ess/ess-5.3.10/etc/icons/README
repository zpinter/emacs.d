Creating pixmaps:

* spluslogo.xpm was dontated by David Smith at Insightful.

* Other icons were created by SJE, using mostly `kiconedit' and
  hand-editing.

* Transparency
Need to add backgrounToolBarColor for XEmacs to show okay.
e.g. /usr/share/xemacs-21.4.12/etc/toolbar/folder-cap-up.xpm
has header:
"X	c Gray75 s backgroundToolBarColor",
whereas I have set "c None" to indicate the background pixel; this line 
seems to work for both toolbars:
". c None s backgroundToolBarColor",
