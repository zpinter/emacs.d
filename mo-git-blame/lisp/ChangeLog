	* mo-git-blame.el (mo-git-blame-process-filter): Avoid hanging
	Emacs if `truncate-partial-width-windows' is set to nil. Fixes
	issue #1.

	* mo-git-blame.el: Scroll both mo-git-blame buffers automatically
	after one of them changes its position. Uses
	`window-scroll-functions' instead of `scroll-all-mode' which
	scrolls too many buffers and doesn't work with e.g. searching.
