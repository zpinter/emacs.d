You might want to use the following code to get Gnome icons in Emacs 21:

  ;; Only for Emacs 21:
  (when (and (not (featurep 'xemacs))
  	   (not (boundp 'image-load-path))
  	   tool-bar-mode)
    (push "/path/to/etc/images/" image-load-path)
    (setq tool-bar-map (make-sparse-keymap))
    (clear-image-cache)
    (tool-bar-setup))


CONVERSION OF PNG FILES TO XPM

The GNOME's stock_*.png files were converted to XPM using the following GIMP
script:

;; -*- scheme -*-
;; Put this file in ~/.gimp-*/scripts/
;; gimp -i -b '(rs-save-as-xpm "foo.png" "foo.xpm" 127)'  '(gimp-quit 0)'
(define (rs-save-as-xpm filename filename2 threshold)
  (let* ((image (car (gimp-file-load RUN-NONINTERACTIVE filename filename)))
	 (drawable (car (gimp-image-get-active-layer image))))
    (file-xpm-save RUN-NONINTERACTIVE image drawable
		   filename2 filename2 threshold)
    (gimp-image-delete image)))
;; end
