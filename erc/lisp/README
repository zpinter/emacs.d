This is the README file for ERC.

ERC is a powerful, modular, and extensible IRC client for Emacs.

Installation
------------

Type `make install'.  This will compile all the emacs-lisp files and
install them in the directory /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/erc.
The info manual will be installed to /usr/local/info.  You'll most
likely need to be the root user to install to these locations.

If you wish to install to someplace else, edit the PREFIX, ELISPDIR,
and/or INFODIR options in Makefile.

QuickStart
-----------

Put all the files in your load-path[0], and add the following to your
~/.emacs:

(require 'erc)

[0] Don't know what a load path is? See:
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?LoadPath

Usage
-----

Use M-x erc to connect to a server.  You can connect to multiple
servers.

Customization
-------------

Use M-x customize-group RET erc RET to get an overview of all the
variables you can tweak.

Documentation
-------------

ERC comes with a manual.  Type `make doc' to get the HTML and Info
versions of it.

Additional documentation is kept on the Emacs Wiki, and may be added
to by anyone.
