;;; Commentary:

;; This package contains tools to do various sorts of whitespace
;; trimming on buffer lines.  The main part is WS Trim mode, which is
;; a minor mode that automatically trims whitespace on text lines.
;; You can control how thorough this mode should be, e.g. whether all
;; lines or only lines you edit should be trimmed.  For further
;; reading see the document strings for the variables `ws-trim-mode'
;; and `ws-trim-level'.
;;
;; To install the package, either issue "(require 'ws-trim)" in a good
;; place (i.e. your .emacs file), or autoload some of the functions
;; below.  You can activate WS Trim mode for a specific buffer by
;; calling `turn-on-ws-trim'.
;;
;; There is also a Global WS Trim mode that automagically turns on WS
;; Trim mode in most buffers.  Put "(global-ws-trim-mode t)" in your
;; .emacs to use it.  By default a heuristic is used to determine if
;; WS Trim mode should be on or off in every buffer.  You can control
;; this through the variable `ws-trim-global-modes'.
;;
;; This package should work with GNU Emacs version 21 and later.
;;
;; Comments, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome.
;;
;; Credits:
;; * Global WS Trim mode is modeled after Global Font Lock mode in
;;   font-lock.el by "jwz, then rms, then sm <simon@gnu.ai.mit.edu>".

;;; Change log:

;; Sat Feb 11 17:51:15 CET 2012       Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  Removed long-since obsolete function make-local-hook which
;;	   no longer exists in Emacs 24.  Thanks to Phil Sainty for
;;	   pointing this out.  Also dropped some more old compat code -
;;	   the baseline is now Emacs 21.
;;
;; Wed Nov 12 18:55:48 CET 2003       Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  Added an indent-tabs-mode sensitive function ws-trim-leading.
;;
;; Thu Jun 19 01:26:51 CEST 2003      Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  Made ws-trim-method-hook buffer local.
;;
;; Fri Oct  5 01:04:17 CEST 2001      Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  Check if the trimming would have any effect before doing it,
;;	   to avoid getting buffers modified unnecessarily.
;;
;; Sat May 15 19:15:24 CEST 1999      Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  Prompt for the trim method when a prefix arg is passed to
;;	   ws-trim-line, ws-trim-region and ws-trim-buffer.
;;
;; Tue Apr  8 00:28:58 MET DST 1997   Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>
;;	*  First public release.

  "*The kind of trimming done by the WS Trim mode and functions.
A single or a list of functions which are run on each line that's
getting trimmed.  Supplied trim functions:

`ws-trim-trailing'        Delete trailing whitespace.
`ws-trim-leading-spaces'  Replace unnecessary leading spaces with tabs.
`ws-trim-leading-tabs'    Replace leading tabs with spaces.
`ws-trim-leading'         Replace leading tabs or spaces according to
                          `indent-tabs-mode'.  If it's nil, leading
                          tabs are replaced with spaces, otherwise
                          it's the other way around.
`ws-trim-tabs'            Replace all tabs with spaces.

functions can of course be used.  There's no inherent restriction to
just whitespace trimming either, for that matter.  Each function

;;; WS Trim mode

;;;###autoload
(defvar ws-trim-mode nil
  "If non-nil, WS Trim mode is active.
This mode automatically trims whitespace on text lines.  The kind of
trimming is specified by the hook `ws-trim-method-hook'.  You can
either trim every line in the buffer or just the lines you edit
manually, see the variable `ws-trim-level' for details.  This mode
runs the hook `ws-trim-mode-hook' when activated.

Please note that there are other common functions, e.g. `indent-to',
`newline-and-indent' (often bound to LFD or RET), `fill-paragraph',
and the variable `indent-tabs-mode', that also trims whitespace in
various circumstances.  They are entirely independent of this mode.

To automatically enable WS Trim mode in any major mode, put
`turn-on-ws-trim' in the major mode's hook, e.g. in your .emacs:

  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-ws-trim)

You can also activate WS Trim mode automagically in all modes where
it's likely to be useful by putting the following in .emacs:

  (global-ws-trim-mode t)

Exactly when WS Trim is activated are by default controlled by a
heuristic, see the function `ws-trim-mode-heuristic' for details.  You
can get more control over the process through the variable
`global-ws-trim-modes'.

This variable automatically becomes buffer local when modified.  It
should not be set directly; use the commands `ws-trim-mode' or
`turn-on-ws-trim' instead.")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'ws-trim-mode)

;;;###autoload
(defvar ws-trim-level 0
  "*How thorough automatic whitespace trimming should be in WS Trim mode.
If 3 or greater, all lines in the buffer are kept trimmed at all
times (if the buffer is modifiable).
If 2, all lines in the buffer are trimmed when the buffer is modified
for the first time.
If 1, only modified lines are trimmed.
If 0, only single modified lines are trimmed, i.e. operations that
modify more than one line don't cause any trimming (newline is an
exception).

The current line is never trimmed on any level, unless the buffer is
about to be written.  In that case the current line is treated as any
other line.

The default level is 0, which is very restrictive.  This is
particularly useful when you edit files which are compared with diff
\(e.g. for patches), because parts that you don't change manually are
kept unchanged.  You can also do block operations over several lines
without risking strange side effects (e.g. paste patches into mails).

This variable automatically becomes buffer local when changed.  Use
the function `set-default' to set the value it defaults to in all new
buffers.  If you want even more control it's best to put a suitable
function onto `ws-trim-mode-hook'.  Changes of `ws-trim-level' might
not take effect immediately; it's best set when the mode is
initialized.")
