;;; Commentary:

;; Allow for execution of ruby processes dumping the results into a
;; compilation buffer.  Useful for executing tests, or rake tasks
;; where the ability to jump to errors in source code is desirable.
;;
;; The functions you will probably want to use are
;; 
;; ruby-compilation-run
;; ruby-compilation-rake
;; ruby-compilation-this-buffer (C-x t)
;; ruby-compilation-this-buffer (C-x C-t)
;;

;;; TODO:

;; Clean up function names so they use a common prefix.
;; "p" doesn't work at the end of the compilation buffer.
;; Package it up with dependencies for ELPA.
