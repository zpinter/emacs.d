It's magit!  A Emacs mode for Git.

I wrote magit while learning about git and trying to figure out how I
would be using git in a 'natural' way.  Magit will grow and hopefully
become more coherent as I learn more about git and good ways to use
it.  Feedback is welcome!

* Installing

Magit can be installed with the popular recipe of

   $ ./autogen.sh     # If you got the sources directly from Git
   $ ./configure
   $ make install

This will put magit.el into /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp, where
Emacs should be able to find it.  Then add

      (require 'magit)

to your .emacs file.

* Getting started

To get started with magit, open any file in a git repository in Emacs
and run 'M-x magit-status'.  Read the online help of magit-mode ('C-h
m' in the magit buffer), make some changes to your files, and try to
commit them.

* Learning more

The Magit User Manual describes things with more words than the online
help.  You can read it in Emacs with 'C-u C-h i magit.info' for
example, or on the web at
