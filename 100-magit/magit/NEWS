Changes in magit 0.6
--------------------

Almost everything has changed.  Please read the manual again.  Some
highlights:

* Magit now works with Git 1.6.0.  (John Wiegley)

* Support for interactive rewriting.

* Sections can be shown and hidden.

* Staging, unstaging, applying, reverting and discarding changes can
  now be done line-by-line, not only hunk-by-hunk.
