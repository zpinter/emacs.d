;; Implemented features which can be tested:
;;
;; * Customization for all flavors of PGP is possible.
;; * The main operations (verify, decrypt, sign, encrypt, sign &
;;   encrypt) are implemented.
;; * Optionally, Gero Treuner's gpg-2comp script is supported, 
;;   to generate data which is compatible with PGP 2.6.3.

;; Customizing external programs 
;; =============================

;; The customization are very similar to those of others programs,
;; only the C-ish "%" constructs have been replaced by more Lisp-like
;; syntax.
;;
;; First, you have to adjust the default executable paths
;; (`gpg-command-default-alist', customization group `gpg-options',
;; "Controlling GnuPG invocation.").  After that, you should
;; change the configuration options which control how specific
;; command line flags are built (`gpg-command-flag-sign-with-key',
;; (`gpg-command-flag-recipient').  The elements of these lists are
;; concatenated without spaces, and a new argument is only started
;; where indicated.  The `gpg-command-flag-recipient' list is special:
;; it consists of two parts, the first one remains at the beginning
;; of the argument, the second one is repeated for each recipient.
;; Finally, `gpg-command-passphrase-env' has to be changed if there's
;; no command line flag to force the external program to read the data
;; from standard input before the message.
;;
;; In customization group `gpg-commands', "Controlling GnuPG
;; invocation.", you have to supply the actual syntax for external
;; program calls.  Each variable consists of a pair of a program
;; specification (if a Lisp symbol is given here, it is translated
;; via `gpg-command-default-alist') and a list of program arguments
;; with placeholders.  Please read the documentation of each variable
;; before making your adjustments and try to match the given
;; requirements as closely as possible!
;;
;; The `gpg-commands-key' group, "GnuPG Key Management Commands.",
;; specifies key management commands.  The syntax of these variables
;; is like those in the `gpg-commands' group.  Note that the output
;; format of some of these external programs has to match very close
;; that of GnuPG.  Additional tools (Thomas Roessler's "pgpring.c")
;; are available if your favorite implementation of OpenPGP cannot
;; output the this format.

;; Security considerations 
;; =======================

;; On a typical multiuser UNIX system, the memory image of the
;; Emacs process is not locked, therefore it can be swapped to disk
;; at any time.  As a result, the passphrase might show up in the
;; swap space (even if you don't use the passphrase cache, i.e. if
;; `gpg-passphrase-timeout' is 0).  If someone is able to run `gdb' or
;; another debugger on your Emacs process, he might be able to recover
;; the passphrase as well.  Unfortunately, nothing can be done in
;; order to prevent this at the moment.
;;
;; BE CAREFUL: If you use the passphrase cache feature, the passphrase
;; is stored in the variable `gpg-passphrase' -- and it is NOT
;; encrypted in any way.  (This is a conceptual problem because the
;; nature of the passphrase cache requires that Emacs is able to
;; decrypt automatically, so only a very weak protection could be
;; applied anyway.)
;;
;; In addition, if you use an unpatched Emacs 20 (and earlier
;; versions), passwords show up in the output of the `view-lossage'
;; function (bound to `C-h l' by default).
